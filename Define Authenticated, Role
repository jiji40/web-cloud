Are we able to check in a View if the currently authenticated user has a certain role?
Yes: @if(!User.IsInRole("ProductManagement")) { @: disabled }

Write the code that only displays a <div> if the user has the "Management" role.
@if(!User.IsInRole("Management")) { <div></div>}

What approaches can be used to send data between an Action and the View?
ViewBag, ViewData, TempData
